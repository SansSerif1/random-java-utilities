# random-java-utilities
Some utilities to make my (and possibly your) coding sessions easier.

## ðŸš¨ EOL ðŸš¨
GitHub has recently shadowbanned (public couldn't see my profile, but I could) for using a ***mail forwarding service, not a temporary mail service***. That means I now cannot trust GitHub with my projects as they can take these down anytime, so now I'm self-hosting my own maven repo.

___***THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN FULLY REWRITTEN FROM SCRATCH, NOW BEING WAY FASTER, SMALLER AND OPTIMIZED ON MY OWN MAVEN REPO - CREATE AN ISSUE OR MESSAGE ME SOMEHOW ELSE IF YOU WANT ACCESS***___

## Features
Some of the cool features:
- a simple CLI with support for custom commands
- simple logger, functions for colored output
- simple database connection manager for JDBC
- **proxy tools for internet scraping.** (SOCKS5-only) 

Manager for loading and selecting proxies (by country and city) and selectable sources of these proxies.
